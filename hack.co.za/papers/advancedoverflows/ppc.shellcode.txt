INTRODUCTION

I realize that *nix on PPC is not terribly common. It was difficult to get
access to a test platform. But PPC sales are taking off and more and more
of their owners are joining the dark side to run *nix. Before you unleash
yourself, ppc admins are probably new to this sort of thing. Please be nice
to them. The enemy of your enemy is your friend.

Both LinuxPPC and BSD (darwin?) versions are included. The only difference
with the BSD version is that it uses system call 59 instead of 11 as execve.
Sorry, no way to test it yet.
		
Lastly, if you use this in a 0 day sploit, I'm sure I can think of someone you
would like to share it with. If you don't write exploits, you're probably
wasting your time emailing me about this.


See you at defcon or toorcon.


SHELLCODE

Making an execve call wasn't too hard, but it's very hard on the PPC to avoid
all the null bytes in the opcodes. There are two very important opcodes which
which can have nulls in them. The first is the sc opcode to make system calls.
I've make the code self-modifying to get around that problem. Hopefully this
won't cause trouble with the instruction cache. It works for me(TM) but YMMV.

The other one is a bit more difficult. We need to give execve an absolute
address to the string "/bin/sh", but since we don't have the help of the ld
we don't have direct access to the absolute address. So there are two
approaches. We could guess its offset relative to the stack pointer (R1)
or frame pointer (R31). Or we could just do the equivalent of a function call
(bl) to store the absolute address in the link register (spr8 and/or on the
stack somewhere). I've chosen the second.

And it's the branch relative instruction that is our second instruction with
null bytes in it. This makes the code longer and even kludgier. The null byte
will disappear if the size of the shellcode is tripled. This version will be
included at the bottom. I've also included a setuid(0) call as part of that
padding.

Of course, it may be possible to work around the need to eliminate null bytes.
If you use the eggshell technique, where you plant the shellcode onto the
stack (ie the ENV) before execing the vulnerable program, and overflow the
vulnerable program's stack only with the return address, you do not need an
uninterupted string of shell opcodes. You can plant the eggshell, then zero
out the remaining null byte (in the branch opcode on the stack in the ENV)
and then exec away.

Oh, if you're writing an exploit, you may arrive at the shellcode after a
second return is called, and not just the return from the function you're in.
The reason for this is that the return address that will be used next is
technically stored on-chip in spr 8, although gcc copies it to and from the
stack (at r1-0x4) but an optimized program will not necessarily do this. You
may have to overwrite the stored value for the next return. 

Suggested nop is 0x7ffffb78.
